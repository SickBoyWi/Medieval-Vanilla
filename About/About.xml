This mod removes everything from the game after the Medieval Era. Everything else stays vanilla. 

How long can you survive what the storyteller is throwing at you?! There really isn't an end game here, since you can't make a spaceship and fly away. 

Notes: 
	*This will conflict with any other mods that reference vanilla items that are post-medieval. The game will still work, but you'll see errors in the log if you look. You may also see errors related to mods referencing post-medieval stuff.
	*This may not work with scenarios that have post-medieval items as a part of the starting items list. You'll see log errors, and the futuristic items won't spawn.
	*NOT COMPATIBLE WITH BIOTECH OR ROYALTY. Those DLCs rely on future tech, and this mod removes that stuff from the game.

I made this at the request of several players who were interested, while the other more popular medieval solutions are updated for the latest game version.
